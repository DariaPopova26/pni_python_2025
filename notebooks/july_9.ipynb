    "Regression (known otherwise as line/curve-fitting) is a powerful and one of the easiest tools you can apply to your dataset. The general goal of regression is to find some appropiate function $f$ that predicts the value of one or more continuous variables $y$ given the value of some $k$-dimensional input variables vector $x$. The simplest form of $f$ is a linear function, which is the focus of this notebook.\n",
