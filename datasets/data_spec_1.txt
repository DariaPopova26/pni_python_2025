The following files are adapted from a published dataset by Daie et al. 2021.

neuron.npz: stores the 2p activity of one neuron during session 74.
- dt: length of a time point in seconds
- nR: number of right trials*
- nL: number of left trials
- y: neural activity, of shape (n_trials x n_time); where n_trials=nR+nL. Note, the first nR trials of y are right trials, followed by nL left trials.
- stim_time: time of stimuli on-, off-set, and go-cue onset, in time points

* right and left trials denote the stimuli direction. Here, we only include data during trials when animals make a correct decision.

many_neuron.npz: stores the 2p activity of many neurons during session 74 (exactly how many is for you to figure out!).
- dt: length of a time point in seconds
- nR: number of right trials
- nL: number of left trials
- y: neural activity, of shape (n_trials x n_time x n_neurons); where n_trials=nR+nL. Note, the first nR trials of y are right trials, followed by nL left trials.
- stim_time: time of stimuli on-, off-set, and go-cue onset, in time points
